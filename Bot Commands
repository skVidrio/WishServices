**Skript - Variables**
Variables are Skript's way to save data. Every variable has a name and a value, i.e. some stored data. You can put variables anywhere in your triggers to replace something, e.g. you can replace a location with a variable that holds a location.
This can for example be used for a /home command: make a variable ‘home’ and a command /home which teleports the player to the location stored in the ‘home’ variable.
To distinguish variables from the rest of the trigger their name has to be put in curly brackets like this: {variable name}. A variable's name can also contain expressions, e.g. to make a ‘home’ variable for every player you can make a variable like {home.%player%} where %player% will be replaced by the player's name every time the variable is used, which essentially creates a ‘home’ variable that is different for every player.

Example:
```cs
on join:
  set {_player} to player
  wait a minute
  message "%{_player}%" # the local variable is unchanged no matter how many players joined in the meantime
```
```cs
options:
  option name = option value
```

/events
-------
The following is a listing of all possible events you can use to start a trigger with. Each trigger can only have one single event, i.e. you cannot create triggers that are called when any of several events occurrs.

Please also note that the ‘on’ at the start of an event is entirely optional but it just looks better in my opinion, and that most events don't have examples since there is only one way to use them.
